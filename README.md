MeteoPredictor
🌦️ Overview
MeteoPredictor is a machine learning-based weather forecasting tool designed to predict key meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Leveraging historical weather data and advanced modeling techniques, this project aims to provide accurate and reliable forecasts.

This repository serves as a foundational step towards a broader initiative focused on analyzing and predicting energy consumption patterns, where weather conditions play a pivotal role.

🔍 Features
Data Acquisition & Preprocessing: Efficient handling of raw weather data, including cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.

Model Training: Implementation of robust machine learning models (e.g., CatBoost) tailored for time-series forecasting.

Evaluation Metrics: Comprehensive assessment of model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

Visualization: Interactive plots and charts to visualize predictions against actual observations.

Modular Architecture: Organized codebase facilitating easy modifications and extensions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Installation
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rav-lad/MeteoPredictor.git
cd MeteoPredictor
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
```
Navigate to the app/ directory and execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```
(Note: Replace main.py with the actual entry-point script if different.)


 Configuration
Configuration files and parameters can be adjusted in the config/ directory to tailor the model to specific datasets or forecasting requirements.

 Future Work
This project lays the groundwork for an upcoming initiative focused on energy consumption prediction. By integrating weather forecasts with energy usage data, the goal is to develop models that can anticipate energy demands, optimize resource allocation, and support sustainable energy management practices.
